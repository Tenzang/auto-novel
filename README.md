"Lets be honest, you're no Mary Shelly - but at least you can be Dr. Frankenstein!


Go to your library to start generating novels. The process is automatic, and before long you'll have your very own (literary) monsters made up of a mish-mosh of user-submitted excerpts.


Oh, and write some of your own excerpts too. It might find its way into someones elses auto-novel - And if it does, you'll be credited!"
